Energy consumption model using data provided by the SAS Analytics Shootout (http://www.sas.com/events/analytics/us/contest.html).  While working as a team, I indivudally explored ensemble techniques to best predict consumption.  In particular, Random Forests, AdaBoost, and Stacking were all explored.  I found that the AdaBoost algorithm was not enough using simple classifiers, and used deep decision trees as my base classifier.  To better visualize the increase in prediction performance, scatterplots of the residuals were made at different rounds of boosting (do take a look at the movies directory!).
